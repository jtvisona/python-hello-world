# TTDL for Python Hello World repo

## Introduction
The goal is to create a repo that is a personal resource for using Python. At first, the project will be done manually,
but as the repo develops, the goal will be to use the language to develop scripts in the language to advance the contents
of the repo more quickly. Then, as the repo becomes more sophisticated, it will incorporate SQL lite and a user interface
so that repo becomes not just a reference, but an application itself to assist in productivity. Ultimately, the third
phase will be to incorporate LLM technology so that prompts and results can be stored and maintained.
